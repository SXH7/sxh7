### About Me

Hello! I am Shashwat, a student pursuing a B.Sc degree in Mathematical Science from DU and an online BS degree in Machine Learning from IIT Madras.
I am interested in AI/ML and GameDev.

My languages of choice are Python and C++ however I usually learn whatever I need to on a project basis.
I use VSCode for most of my coding and I'm the most familiar with the Godot game engine.
